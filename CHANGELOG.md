### Changed
- Update UI to implement responsive design. The interface now adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
- Updates HTML/CSS part to simplify the code and improve readability.

## [0.8 3] - 2025-06-11

### Fixed
- ModelWeb.to_json() to include objects not linked to any System when downloading json file.
- upgrade to e-footprint 10.1.7 to fix object deletion logic.

## [0.8.2] - 2025-06-10

### Fixed
- Call generic self_delete() method when deleting UsagePattern, to make sure that its Devices, Network and Country are deleted if they are not attributes of any UsagePattern anymore.

## [0.8.1] - 2025-06-10

### Fixed
- Save calculated attributes to json for objects not linked to system + upgrade to e-footprint 10.1.6 so that server and system recompute their attributes when a service is installed on a server.

## [0.8.0] - 2025-06-04

### Changed
- Cache calculated attributes and update model in real time as the user interacts with it.

## [0.7.23] - 2025-05-26

### Added
- Highlight the object in the model canvas when the user clicks on i. If it is a mirrored object, the corresponding objects are also highlighted in the model canvas.

### Changed
- Load e-footprint objects in settings.py so that they are already loaded even in the first user interaction.

## [0.7.22] - 2025-05-22

### Added

- Edit icon appears when hovering over an object name in object cards.

### Fixed
- Remove " ' " for exported json filename.

### Changed
- Minimum number of instances is set to 1 so that BoaviztaCloudServer doesnâ€™t get reimported every time the first instance is created.

## [0.7.21] - 2025-05-15

### Changed

- UI has been updated to use d-flex components instead of row/col for more 
  flexibility.
- Updates in CSS to unify rules about object addition.

## [0.7.20] - 2025-05-15

### Fixed
- Provider edit when result panel is open. Now ModelingUpdate is used to update both provider and model name so that e-footprint doesnâ€™t raise an error when provider is updated.

### Changed
- Datalist values (for example gen AI model name) now have same logic as name field: in the add panel when clicking the value is deleted.
- When opening the confirm delete modal, the side panel is not closed anymore so that clicking "go back" allows to go back to the side panel.

## [0.7.19] - 2025-05-12

### Changed
- Change behavior of the result panel to allow its display when side panel 
  is open. A side panel form submit if the result panel is open now triggers 
  a recomputation of the model.

## [0.7.18] - 2025-05-13

### Added
- On add/edit/delete object, a toast is displayed to inform the user that 
  the action has been successfully completed. For Add and Edit, related 
  objects are highlighted in the model canvas.

### Fixed
- Object name in edit panel remains after clicking on the name field.

## [0.7.17] - 2025-05-07

### Changed
- Simplify server labels but keep more descriptive labels for server type selection.
- In usage pattern form, for new usage patterns, the field initial_usage_journey_volume isn't set to a default value and the timeseries chart isn't diplayed. Once all informations are filled, the chart is displayed.
- Refactoring: In SCSS file, remove all references to property z-index and use bootstrap class instead. For leaderline, use z-index defined in bootstrap variables.

### Fixed
- Leaderline z-index is now below upload and download toolbar.

## [0.7.16] - 2025-05-06

### Fixed
- Backend and frontend updates to use form units in the edit/add views. This allows for uploading models with units different from default units and keep unit consistency.

### Changed
- In code, rename duplicated cards to mirrored cards.
- Round usage projection figures to 1.
- Form fields steps (for example, step is now 1 for electricity carbon intensity, instead of 0.1).
- Automatically round integer default values (to display 100.0 as 100 for example)
- In forms remove object type sections when there is a single object type to select (for example, job type in job form).

## [0.7.15] - 2025-05-05

### Changed
- Re-put yearly emission breakdown as default + use CO2-eq as emission unit
- Update to e-footprint 10.0.11 gives better default units especially for carbon intensity of electricity (gCO2-eq/kWh and not kgCO2-eq/kWh)

### Fixed
- Result charts labels (sometimes cumulative emissions line chart had yearly labels when it should always be monthly).
- Use GPUJob instead of Job when making a request to a GPU server, to use the right compute unit.

## [0.7.14] - 2025-05-05

### Changed
- Result panel has been updated to have both dashboards on large screens and a single dashboard by row on small screens.
- Refactor HTML part in base/home/moder_builder/result to reduce useless 
  components and improve readability.

- Change CSS rules to improve the overall display
- Refactor the CSS part to be fully managed into SCSS files and re-organize 
  the custom SCSS file.
- Add custom labels for calculated attributes.

### Fixed

- Available job types show now the label instead of the class name in the 
  select field
- In Safari select multiple fields donâ€™t have a visible hidden value anymore, while retaining the fact that the forms will always send a value for select multiple fields, even if no value has been selected.
- Number format in charts y axis (from indian to english format)
- Deletion logic for mirrored cards (for example, trying to delete a job that belongs to a mirrored user journey step would raise an error).

## [0.7.12] - 2025-04-23

### Fixed

- Fix charts in result panel and usage pattern time series form to always 
  start Y-axis at 0.

## [0.7.11] - 2025-04- 17

### Added

- Add Y-axis title "Number of usage journeys" and change label displayed in 
  the tooltip.

## [0.7.8] - 2025-04-15

### Fixed
- Use correct labels for objects in forms and sources.

### Changed

- Minimum set to 0 except for inputs that can be negative (job data stored attribute for example).
- Possibility to define custom numerical input step for each attribute (for example, the compute step is 1 in server form and the average carbon intensity step is 0.01, default is 0.1).

## [0.7.7] - 2025-04-14

### Fixed
- Harmonize usage pattern time series css with other object forms.

### Changed

## [0.7.4] - 2025-04-10

### Fixed
- Usage pattern time series chart JS options were those of result panel, now they are back to the 
  original ones. Fixes https://github.com/Boavizta/e-footprint-interface/issues/14
- When deleting modeling duration in usage pattern form, the time series chart is not updated so the field can be empty. It is still required for form submission though. Fixes https://github.com/Boavizta/e-footprint-interface/issues/16
- Update to efootprint 10.0.9 to fix date errors due to DST conversions.
- Round UsagePatternFromForm number of days to previous int to avoid having an extra day in next modeling year because pint year duration is 365.25 days.

## [0.7.3] - 2025-04-07

### Changed
- UsagePatternFromForm form fields now have same formatting as other object fields.

## [0.7.1] - 2025-04-02

### Changed
- Updated to e-footprint 10.0.6 so Boaviztapi calls are now done through the python package and not through the API anymore.

### Fixed
- Updated to e-footprint 10.0.6 so BoaviztaCloudServer compute and ram values are fixed (they used to be vastly overestimated which resulted in underestimation of environmental impact).

## [0.7.0] - 2025-03-31

### Changed
- In add end edit server panels, there is now a dedicated part of the form to define 
  storage attributes.
- In edit panel, storage calculated attributes are displayed when available.

## [0.6.8] 2025-03-27

### Fixed
- Make sure all footprint values share same period index and compute daily aggregation server side instead of client side. This fixes results in case the model is made of usage patterns with disjoint time periods.

## [0.6.7] 2025-03-25

### Changed
- In result panel time granularity can now only be chosen for bar chart and not for line chart anymore.
- In result panel monthly and yearly values are expressed in a calendar way (e.g. january 2025) instead of with dates.

### Fixed
- efootprint rounding error by upgrading to 10.0.4
- Possibility to have user journey with duration of 0 by upgrading to efootprint 10.0.4

## [0.6.6] 2025-03-20

### Changed

- Add a default UsageJourney and a default UsageJourneyStep 
  in default modeling.

### Fixed
- SVG url for usageJourney in understand page has been fixed.

## [0.6.4] 2025-03-17

### Changed
- Add default object names for new objects (object type + object, e.g. UsageJourney 3).

## [0.6.3] 2025-03-17

### Fixed
- Initial number of visits on first day is now computed so that the sum of visits over the first initial usage journey volume timespan is equal to user input. For example, if modeling start date is 2025-04-01 (April is a month with exactly 30 days) and the user inputs 10000 initial visits monthly, the sum of visits for April should be 10000 (despite the fact that growth is computed daily).

  incomplete but it was covered by the empty result panel which wasn't hidden.

## [0.6.1] - 2025-03-13

### Fixed
 - Updating modeling duration value in usage pattern form updates time series graph.
 - Start date is internally converted into local timezone start date in UsagePatternFromForm so that when it is converted to UTC it is the same date as the one selected by the user.
 - Make sure form inputs donâ€™t overlay result chart.

### Changed
- js logic trigger management (code refactoring).

## [0.4.3] - 2025-02-21
