I have added a new EdgeDevice object to the e-footprint library, implemented in efootprint.core.hardware.edge.edge_device. I want that this device type becomes available alongside the EdgeComputer and EdgeAppliance device types, when the user clicks the "Add edge device" button. When creating an EdgeDevice, the "components" parameter will be ignored and so left empty. The new EdgeDevice object will appear in the Infrastructure section, and will have a custom object card. Indeed, its object card will have an accordion that will allow the user to click an "Add component" button, similar to the "Install service" button found on server cards. Make a plan for the introduction of this new object to the interface. Think hard and don’t hesitate to aske clarifying questions if needed. You will need to continue developping the EdgeDeviceWeb class I created in model_builder/web_core/hardware/edge/edge_device_web.py, and update the EdgeDeviceBase class, probably also the add_edge_device.html template.


Ok now that you’ve implemented the EdgeDevice object creation, create a simple test in test_views_addition_edge.py that creates an EdgeDevice and verifies it’s been added correctly. As much as possible, use generic functions like create_post_data_from_class_default_values from TestModelingBase to simplify test syntax.
Ok good now create a simple cypress test in test_edge_objects.cy.js that tests the addition of an EdgeDevice through the web interface. The test should verify that the EdgeDevice appears in the Infrastructure section and that the "Add component" accordion works as expected.


The components shouldn’t need to have all their own add template. And ModelWeb.edge_devices will already work well because EdgeComputer and EdgeAppliance inherit from EdgeDevice.
